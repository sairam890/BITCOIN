# Temporal-Dynamics
In this project, we will examine the nomenclature of non-volatile cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, focusing on how they are named. I will use Bitcoin as an example of a non-volatile cryptocurrency and USDTether as a representative stablecoin. I used LSTM and GNN for prediction and Hypothesistesting for validation.
